The Bra(c)ket notation was deveop by Paul A. M. Dirac

In the Stern-Gerlach experiment, states spanned a complex vector space with a dimmensionality of 2, for the two possible values of $S_{\rm z}$, which are spin-up and spin down. These also correspond to the two paths that the silver atoms can follow when subjected to the a SG apparatus.

The physical state of a system is described by a \textbf{state vector} in the complex space. For example, in the Stern-Gerlach experiment, this was the spin orientation $S_{\rm z}$. A vector in the complex space is known as a $\texbf{ket}$, and is denoted by $\bra{\alpha}$


\begin{align*}
  \bra{a}       &= \bra*{\frac{a}{1}} \\
  \ket{a}       &= \ket*{\frac{a}{1}} \\
  \braket{a}{b} &= \braket*{\frac{a}{1}}{\frac{b}{1}}
\end{align*}
